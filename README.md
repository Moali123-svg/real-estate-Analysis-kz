I have analyzed “Real estate and housing in kazakhstan”by gathering Data from krisha.kz as the main website of my project. I have already learned how to parse this site, so it will be a big plus for me.
Krisha.kz Krisha is the main website of my project. Krisha is the main website that residents of Kazakhstan use for renting and selling Real estate.
The main idea of the project and the importance of analyzing real estate

This analysis will help you understand the current housing market, how much properties similar to yours are worth. The information gathered through an analysis of the main website in Krisha.kz about real estate and housing. It helps the seller choose a price for their house and helps buyers see if the asking price is too high, low or reasonable. By comparing similar properties on the market, you will be able to accurately put a price on a home.
It also helps to compare prices in different cities or in different districts in one city. In order to give an answer for these kinds of demands,I wrote main questions to analyze using krisha.kz.

### Main questions:
1. The districts with the most expensive and cheapest housing on average?
2. The most expensive/cheapest apartments for each type of apartment.
3. The largest/smallest apartments for each type of apartment.
